Guns N' Roses - "Get in the Ring"
Why do you look at me when you hate me?
Why should I look at you when you make me hate you too?
I sense a smell of retribution in the air
I don't even understand why the fuck you even care
And I don't need your jealousy yeah
Why drag me down in your misery
And when you stare you don't think I feel it
But I'm gonna deal it back to you in spades
When I'm havin' fun ya know I can't conceal it
'cause I know you'd never cut in my game, oh no
And when you're talkin' about a vasectomy, yeah
I'll be writin' down your obituary...history!
You got your bitches with the silicone injections
Crystal meth and yeast infections
Bleached blond hair, collagen lip projections
Who are you to criticize my intentions?
Got your subtle manipulative devices
Just like you I got my vices
I got a thought that would be nice
I'd like to crush your head tight in my vice...pain!!
And that goes for all of you punks in the press
That want to start shit by printin' lies instead of the things we said
That means you andy secher at hit parader, circus magazine
Mick wall at kerrang, bob guccione jr. at spin
What you pissed off 'cause your dad gets more pussy than you?
Fuck you! suck my fuckin' dick!
You be rippin' off the fuckin' kids
While they be payin' their hard earned money to read about the bands they want to know about
Printin' lies, startin' controversy
You want to antagonize me? antagonize me motherfucker!
Get in the ring motherfucker! and I'll kick your bitchy little ass! punk!!
I don't like you, I just hate you
I'm gonna kick your ass, oh yeah! oh yeah!
You may not like our integrity yeah
We built a world out of anarchy oh yeah!
And in this corner, weighing in at 850 pounds; guns n' roses!
Get in the ring(x16)
This song is dedicated to all the guns n' fuckin' roses fans
Who stuck with us through all the fucking shit
And to all those opposed...hmm...well...
